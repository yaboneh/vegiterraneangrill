     <p style="padding: 10px 500px 10px; float:right" >Our father, Andreas Demetriou, came to the United States as a young boy in the 60â€™s with his mother, our Yia-Yia, to restart their lives. As a way to give back to the community, he started this grill to share authentic Greek cuisine with the greater LA area, filling the air with the scent of smokey shawarma, unique textures of the crispy, yet simultaneously soft falafel, and other delectable items to have you feeling the rustling of olive trees and the mist from the Mediterranean all in the way in Southern California.We are proud to announce that we are now purely vegan! As times changed, our family-owned business shifted to a more sustainable and animal-friendly menu. Animal husbandry is becoming increasingly cruel while directly affecting climate change, which is gaining momentum daily. Becoming vegan gave us hope that our decision, though small, could help bring change in the way we consume our food. Our kitchen caters to everyone, vegan or not, so non-veg-lovers can still enjoy their favorite Mediterranean dishes without being able to distinguish between real and substitute meat.
We collaborate with local farms Urban Homestead in Pasadena, Forneris Farms in Mission Hills, and ECo Urban Gardens in Los Angeles to deliver fresh produce directly from the source straight to your plate.
 <br><br>Meet us at our location in Burbank next to McCambridge Park.
